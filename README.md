# Household-electricity-consuption-using-LSTM
The objective is to  build robust time series forecasting models that can accurately predict future electricity  consumption trends based on historical data. The insights derived from this analysis can empower  households to optimize energy usage, plan efficiently, and contribute to sustainable energy  practices.


Dataset Description:
1. Date: Date of the electricity consumption recording.
2. Time: Time of the electricity consumption recording.
3. Global_active_power: Total active power consumed by the household.
4. Global_reactive_power: Total reactive power consumed by the household.
5. Voltage: Voltage level during the electricity consumption period.
6. Global_intensity: Total current intensity consumed by the household.
7. Sub_metering_1: Electricity consumption in sub-metering 1 (e.g., kitchen).
8. Sub_metering_2: Electricity consumption in sub-metering 2 (e.g., laundry).
9. Sub_metering_3: Electricity consumption in sub-metering 3 (e.g., water heater).

Deliverables:
- Python scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, and time series prediction models.
- Visualizations illustrating consumption patterns, model evaluation metrics, and predicted future 
trends.
- A comprehensive report summarizing the findings, challenges encountered, and recommendations 
for optimizing household electricity consumption.
