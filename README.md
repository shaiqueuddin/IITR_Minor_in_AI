# Household-Energy-consumption-Predictive-Analysis

**Problem Statement**: 
Households and utilities often lack predictive foresight, making demand spikes, billing shocks, and grid strain harder to manage. 

**Project Aim:**
Evaluate whether LSTM and GRU sequence models can reliably forecast energy consumption trends using historical load data and exogenous variables (e.g., temperature), and determine if these forecasts can drive actionable insights.

**Objective:**
The aim Project tests whether an LSTM and GRU sequence model can reliably predict consumption trends using past loads and exogenous variables (e.g., temperature), and whether such forecasts can inform actionable insights. The objective is to  build robust time series forecasting models that can accurately predict future Energy  consumption trends based on historical data. The insights derived from this analysis can empower  households to optimize energy usage, plan efficiently, and contribute to sustainable energy  practices. The focus is on the Electrical energy Consumption.

**Dataset Description**:
1. Date: Date of the electricity consumption recording.
2. Time: Time of the electricity consumption recording.
3. Global_active_power: Total active power consumed by the household.
4. Global_reactive_power: Total reactive power consumed by the household.
5. Voltage: Voltage level during the electricity consumption period.
6. Global_intensity: Total current intensity consumed by the household.
7. Sub_metering_1: Electricity consumption in sub-metering 1 (e.g., kitchen).
8. Sub_metering_2: Electricity consumption in sub-metering 2 (e.g., laundry).
9. Sub_metering_3: Electricity consumption in sub-metering 3 (e.g., water heater).

**Deliverables**:
- Python scripts/ Colab Notebook for data preprocessing, EDA, and time series prediction models.
- Annotation of Code in the Colab Notebook
- Visualizations illustrating consumption patterns, model evaluation metrics, and predicted future trends.
